## 2.0.0 Changelog

### Features

* Swift 3.1 support removed, the minimum supported release is now 4.0.
* New error handling for GPIO,1Wire, ADC, I2C, UART, SPI and PWM


### API Changes

* All enums are now lowercase, more importantly the pins `.P<n>` enums are now `.pin<n>`
* Custom GPIO objects can now be declared with just a numeric Id
* Most I/O functions in GPIO,1Wire, ADC, I2C, UART, SPI and PWM throws Errors instead of aborting.
* GPIO API changes:
    - Value is now a boolean (true=1/High, false=0/Low)
    - New throwing `enable()` method that throws if a GPIO cannot be initialized correctly or if it's unreadable for SysFS GPIOs.
    I/O methods still crash on I/O errors for now, `enable()` can be optionally used  to check beforehand for setup issues.
* PWM API changes:
    - `initPWM` -> Throwing `enable`
    - `startPWM` -> `start`
    - `stopPWM` -> `stop`
    - `initPWMPattern` -> `initPattern`

### Bug fixes, internal changes

* RaspberryPi presets use the detected cpu architecture to determine the baseAddress
* `PWMOutput` is now `PWMInterface`, `GPIO` now implements `GPIOInterface`, `GPIO` is now `SysFSGPIO`.
* Fixed initalization issue for GPIO.pull
* Updated the examples to Swift 4.0, long overdue
* Updated project structure
* API Tests
